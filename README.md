This is a collection of scripts I've written over the years.

I keep them on github so they're always backed up, easy to access from anywhere,
and available to anyone else who might find them useful.

pydnbshare.py
-------------
A python script to download all the MP3s from dnbshare.com's rss feed. It even
gets around the stupid anti-linking measures they have :) (that was fun to 
figure out btw)

dme.py
------
A python script to add/remove DNS records using the DNS Made Easy rest API. For 
more info, see:
http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/services/rest-api/

gtrss.py
--------
A Python script that downloads latest releases from a certain torrent site. See 
script comments for configuration.
